# Project overview
This repository is a personal learning eBook that contains course-style content across multiple topics, including programming languages, tools, frameworks, platforms, systems, and concepts. The content is continuously updated and expanded.

## Organization (recommended)
- docs/general/           # 通識 (e.g., 高效會議管理)
- docs/git/               # Git learning center (was `Git_eBook`)
- docs/python/            # Python materials (was `Python_eBook`)
  - docs/python/basic/    # Python 基礎 (PythonBasic examples and lessons)
  - docs/python/advanced/ # Python 進階
  - docs/python/pytest/   # pytest course
  - docs/python/uv_package/ # uv package course
- docs/ai-tools/          # AI tools and Copilot materials (was `GithubCopilot_eBook`)

## Guidelines
- Each topic should live in its own folder under `docs/`.
- Content pages should be written in Markdown (`.md`).
- Each chapter should include theory, examples, exercises, and challenges.

If you prefer the old layout, the previous locations are preserved in the `reorg/docs-structure` branch.
